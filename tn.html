          <h3>1. Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameshwaram</h3>
          <p>Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameshwaram is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples and a holy pilgrimage site for the Hindus. It is believed that the Shiva Lingam placed at the temple was built and worshipped by Lord Ram before crossing the bridge to Lanka, and that is where the name Ramanathaswamy was derived. Lord Ram wanted to seek forgiveness from his lord for the sins he would commit during the war against Ravana. He requested Hanuman to bring a Lingam from the Himalayas. However, with his delayed arrival, Lord Ram decided to build a Lingam from sand, which is placed at the sanctum. The temple has another lingam which was brought from Kailash and is called Vishwalingam.
